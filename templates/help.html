            <h2>How do I start a scan?</h2>
            <p>Navigate to the "Start Scan" section from the menu, enter the website URL, and click the Scan button. The scan will begin, and a PDF report will be generated.</p>

            <h2>What types of vulnerabilities are checked?</h2>
            <p>Our scanner checks for common issues like open ports (via Nmap), SQL Injection, XSS, missing security headers, and exposed directories.</p>

            <h2>Where can I find previous scan results?</h2>
            <p>Go to the "Scan Tracker" section in the menu to view a history of all scans performed. You can also download their respective PDF reports.</p>

            <h2>What should I do if a vulnerability is found?</h2>
            <p>Each result in the report includes a mitigation tip. For serious issues, contact your web hosting provider or security team for assistance.</p>

            <h2>Is this scanner legal to use on any website?</h2>
            <p>No. Only scan websites you own or have permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.</p>
