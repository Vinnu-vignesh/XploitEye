        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>ExploitEye</strong> — a passionate initiative aimed at making the web a safer place.</p>
        
        <p>We are a team of enthusiastic final-year Computer Science students driven by a shared mission: to empower individuals and organizations with the tools and knowledge to defend against cyber threats. In a digital world where vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences, we believe security should be accessible, understandable, and actionable — not just for experts, but for everyone.</p>
        
        <p>ExploitEye was born out of this vision. It’s more than just a vulnerability scanner — it’s a platform designed to educate, inform, and assist users in identifying and resolving website security issues. By integrating industry-standard tools like <strong>Nmap</strong> and <strong>OWASP ZAP</strong>, along with our own custom Python modules, we created a solution that bridges the gap between raw technical scans and human-friendly security insights.</p>
        
        <p>We see <strong>ExploitEye</strong> as the first step — a foundation for something greater. Whether you're a developer, a cybersecurity enthusiast, or an ethical hacker, we built this for you.</p>
        
        <p><em>Thank you for exploring ExploitEye. Together, let’s make the internet a safer space — one scan at a time.</em></p>
